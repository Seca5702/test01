Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we gained valuable insights and prepared the data for modeling. Cleaning processes were applied to eliminate outliers and handle null values, while appropriate transformations were employed to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.\n",

The R2 score, being scale-independent, enables us to compare models with different target variables or units of measurement. This provides a robust framework for assessing model performance across various problem domains.\n",

        "**The \"Bike Sharing Demand Prediction\" project addresses the challenge faced by bike sharing companies in accurately forecasting and meeting the fluctuating demand for bike rentals. The unpredictable nature of bike rental demand poses difficulties in managing fleet size, allocating resources, and providing optimal customer service. Without a reliable demand prediction system, bike sharing companies often struggle to ensure a sufficient number of bikes are available during peak periods, resulting in frustrated customers and missed revenue opportunities. Conversely, overestimating demand leads to surplus bikes and unnecessary operational costs. Therefore, the problem at hand is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately forecast bike rental demand, enabling companies to optimize fleet management, allocate resources efficiently, and deliver an exceptional user experience while maximizing profitability.**"

This approach allows algorithms to interpret categorical variables without assuming any ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",

This can be useful when there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",

        "We began our analysis by performing EDA on all of our datasets. First, we looked at and changed our dependent variable, \"Rental Bike Count.\" After that, we looked at categorical variables and numerical variables and discovered their correlation, distribution, and connection to the dependent variable. Additionally, we hot-encoded the categorical variables and removed some numerical features which are used only for EDA purposes and have multi-collinearity.\n",

        "Following that, we examine several well-known individual models, ranging from straightforward Linear Regression and Regularization Models (Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net) to more complex and ensemble models like Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Light GBM. To enhance the performance of our model, we performed hyperparameter tuning."

        "- The majority of rentals are for daily commutes to workplaces and colleges. Therefore open additional stations near these landmarks to reach their primary customers.\n",
        "- While planning for extra bikes to stations the peak rental hours must be considered, i.e. 7–9 am and 5–6 pm.\n",
        "- Maintenance activities for bikes should be done at night due to the low usage of bikes during the night time. Removing some bikes from the streets at night time will not cause trouble for the customers.\n",
        "2. We see 2 rental patterns across the day in bike rental count - first for a Working Day where the rental count is high at peak office hours (8 am and 5 pm) and the second for a Non-working day where the rental count is more or less uniform across the day with a peak at around noon.\n",
        "3. Hour of the day: Bike rental count is mostly correlated with the time of the day. As indicated above, the count reaches a high point during peak hours on a working day and is mostly uniform during the day on a non-working day.\n",
        "4. Temperature: People generally prefer to bike at moderate to high temperatures. We see the highest rental counts between 32 to 36 degrees Celcius\n",
        "5. Season: We see the highest number of bike rentals in the Spring (July to September) and Summer (April to June) Seasons and the lowest in the Winter (January to March) season.\n",
        "6. Weather: As one would expect, we see the highest number of bike rentals on a clear day and the lowest on a snowy or rainy day\n",
        "7. Humidity: With increasing humidity, we see a decrease in the bike rental count.\n",
        "8. I have chosen the Light GBM model which is above all else I want better expectations for the rented_bike_count and time isn't compelling here. As a result, various linear models, decision trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boost techniques were used to improve accuracy. I compared R2 metrics to choose a model.\n",
        "9. Due to less no. of data in the dataset, the training R2 score is around 99% and the test R2 score is 92.5%. Once we get more data we can retrain our algorithm for better performance."

Therefore, there will be scenarios where the model might not perform well. As Machine learning is an exponentially evolving field, we will have to be prepared for all contingencies and also keep checking our model from time to time. Therefore, having quality knowledge and keeping pace with the ever-evolving ML field would surely help one to stay a step ahead in the future."
